# Introduction

Welcome to the SE Curriculum team's Canvas training course! In this course,
we'll show you how to create and maintain curriculum materials using GitHub and
Canvas. By the end of the course, you'll be able to:

- Create a new lesson in GitHub and synchronize it with a Canvas blueprint
  course
- Update a lesson's GitHub repository and synchronize the updates with a Canvas
  blueprint course
- Use GitHub issues and PRs to resolve lesson feedback
- Use the Canvas blueprint system to synchronize updates with multiple courses

This course is designed in a similar manner as our student-facing courses, so
you'll be making getting hands-on Canvas practice by making updates directly in
this course as you work through it.
